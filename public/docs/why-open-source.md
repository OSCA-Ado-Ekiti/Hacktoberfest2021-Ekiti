## What is Open Source?

Open source is source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution. Products include permission to use the source code,design documents,or content of the product. The open-source model is a decentralized software development model that encourages open collaboration.

## What is a pull request?

A pull request is a method of submitting contributions to an open development project. It is often the preferred way of submitting contributions to a project using a distributed version control system (DVCS) such as Git. A pull request occurs when a developer asks for changes committed to an external repository to be considered for inclusion in a project’s main repository.
